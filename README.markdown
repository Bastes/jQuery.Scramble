= jQuery Scramble plugin

Randomly scrambles elements of a jQuery collection so they end up in a
(hopefully different) randomized order.

This plugin respects jQuery's chaining conventions, so you can .end() after
manipulating a scrambled selection and get the original order back.

Use :

    $([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).scramble();

    $('#whatever .you select').scramble();
